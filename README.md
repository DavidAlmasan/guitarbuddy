# GuitarBuddy

An app that listens to your guitar playing and creates a similar song based on your chord progression and tempo

Hopefully have Android integration by 2018

#DONE
Python 2 script that listens to your playing through the microphone and logs INDIVIDUAL GUITAR NOTES. No guitar chords as of yet.
Python 3 script that loads takes a list of guitar notes, and creates a WAV file of the note progression 
#TODO
Python 3 script that takes a recording of multiple iterations of the same chord and splits the audio file into WAV files that each contain one strumming of the chord
Transition from Python 2 to Python 3 (**)
Create a neural network that recognises guitar chords instead of relying on Fourier Transform
(**) This step is optional as we wish to move to neural networks ( 3) ) as means of ID
